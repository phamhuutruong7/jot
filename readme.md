This project followed a tutorial on Udemy (Laravel API Development & Vue JS SPA from Scratch)
The author of this tutorial is Victor Gonzalez (aka Coder's Tape on youtube). 

This project started with writing TDD (Test Driven Development aka Test First - Code Second).
The tutorial guided me from writing test case then design API, then sending data through API and display them in the Vue Components. 
It also have the guide to use Tailwindcss (which I've never been using before) and also with Laravel Scout (with TNTSearch)
